  <h1>ðŸ¥¨ Cinnamon Bun</h1>
  <p>
    "Kanelbullar" or cinnamon buns are a classic at Swedish coffee parties. During the golden age of home baking, such
    parties turned into orgies of sweet yeast breads, small cookies, cookies with fillings, pastries and cakes. This
    tradition
    lives on in Sweden.
    <br />
    <br />
    If you are invited to someoneâ€™s home for coffee, you always get a cinnamon bun, a cookie or a piece of cake with it.
    And at cafÃ©s, dainty little cookies continue to compete with all those supersized American muffins.
